### Abstract

Rarefied flow of nitrogen gas through long circular tubes was experimentally studied. Measurements were made of the mass flow, pressure drop and cross-sectional velocity profiles. The **Knudsen number** at the entrance to the tube ranged from **0.24 to 0.007**. The overall **pressure ratios across the Iength** of the tube varied from **1.2 to 90**. The experiments showed that in the slip flow regime there was excellent agreement between experimental and theory based on the assumptions of isothermal and locally fully developed flow. Comparisons with theory using second order boundary conditions were also made at low pressures.

> The flow of rarefied gases through tubes at very large pressure ratio levels is an interesting problem as it would permit some or all of the flow regimes to coexist as the degree of rarefaction increases along the length of the tube due to a pressure gradient.

### Experimental Setup

- Nitrogen at RT ~ 23$\degree$C
- Polished brass tube connection two vacuum chambers. Constant pressure differential.
- Tube lengths - 9.54, 19.32, 30.06 (inches); Internal Diameter - 2 inch
- Measurand - Mass flow and Pressure drop along length

### Observations

The slip coefficient appears to be dependent on the degree of rarefaction.

Experimental results corresponded better with a higher slip coefficient at a higher Kn, however since no effort was made to make the tube surface smooth(er), the change cannot be attributed to a higher fraction specular reflections.

Agreement between theoretical and experimental results at Kn < 0.13 justifies the locally fully developed assumption.

First order slip theory is inadequate at Kn > 0.13
Coefficient-corrected Deissler and Cercignaniâ€™s second order slip theory can be used at higher Knudsen numbers, till Kn = 1.5
At low pressures the measured mass flow was found to approach free molecule flow theoretical values much faster in long tubes than in short tubes.
