### Boltzmann Equation

The solution is a single particle distribution function. Macroscopic parameters (density, velocity) are obtained by taking moments of the distribution function.

üí° Moment of a distribution function
If the function is a probability distribution, then the first moment is the expected value, the second central moment¬†is the¬†variance, the third standardized moment¬†is the skewness, and the fourth standardized moment is the kurtosis.

</aside>

The solution is a distribution function $f(\bold{x}, \bold{c}, t)$, which expresses the probability of finding a molecule in a volume $d\bold{x}$ having velocity in the range $\bold{c}$ to $\bold{c} + d\bold{c}$  at time $t$.

Mathematical representation -

$J(f,f_{1})$ is the collision integral.

Phase space - $d\bold{x}d\bold{c}$
Physical space - $d\bold{x}$
Velocity space - $d\bold{c}$

Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is the solution for a simple case when the gas is at rest ‚Üí no density or temperature gradients.

### Extraction of Macroscopic Quantities

Number density is simplified and shown with just one integral sometimes.

$$
n = \int{\int{\int_{-\infin}^{\infin} f(\bold{x},\bold{c}, t)d\bold{c}}}
$$

$$
n = \int{f(\bold{x},\bold{c},t)d\bold{c}}
$$

Mass density and macroscopic velocity of the gas in the $\text{i}$-th direction.

$$
\rho = m\int{f(\bold{x},\bold{c},t)d\bold{c}}
$$

$$
u_{i} = \frac{1}{n}\int{c_{i}f(\bold{x},\bold{c},t)d\bold{c}}
$$

And hence the mass flow in the $\text{i}$-th direction- 

$$
\rho u_{i} = m\int{c_{i}f(\bold{x},\bold{c},t)d\bold{c}}
$$

Concept of peculiar velocity $\bold{C}(\bold{x}, \bold{c}, t)$ is defined to work in the frame of reference moving with gas at local velocity $u_{i}$. Integrating peculiar velocity over the distribution gives you zero, because random motion.

Manipulating the energy density expression using peculiar velocity gives you the standard macroscopic kinetic energy density and a new internal energy density term ($\rho\epsilon$).

$$
\rho e = \frac{m}{2}\int{ C^{2}fd\bold{c}}+ \frac{\rho}{2}u^{2}
$$

$$
\rho\epsilon = \frac{m}{2}\int{C^{2}fd\bold{c}}
$$

### General form for Higher Order Moments

(Using a control volume analysis, kind of)

Consider a general density $\bold{G}$ and its flow through a surface $dS$ which has the normal $\bold{c}$ component to be $c_{n}$. The flow of the quantity per unit area per unit time would be $\int{c_{n}\, G\,d\bold{c}}$. 

Substituting $G = c_{j}f$ would give the j-th component of momentum in the i-th direction. In addition to the macroscopic momentum flow term, there appears a pressure term by virtue of random molecular motion.

Similar analysis for the energy flow with $G = \frac{1}{2}c^{2}f$, yields the expected macroscopic energy flow term and the work done by stress term, along with a heat flux vector ($\bold{q}$).

 

<aside>
üí° In the Navier Stokes, viscous force and conduction are also referred to as the diffusion terms. They are due to the random motion of the molecules.

### Evolution Equations for Moment

The Boltzmann equation is multiplied by a factor/faction to directly track the evolution of macroscopic parameters.

![Untitled](chap_5_images/Untitled%201.png)

where $\xi$ controls the macroscopic parameter and $\braket{\,}$ denotes moment.

$$
\rho\braket{\xi} = m\int{\xi f\,d\bold{c}}
$$

$P_{\xi}$ is the rate of molecular property $\xi$, per unit volume, because of collisions. In the case of elastic collisions, it evaluates to zero.
