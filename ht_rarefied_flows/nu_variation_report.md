[ht characteristics of rarefied flows (A. Jha, A. Agarwal)](Jha%20et%20al.pdf)

In high Knudsen flows (slip and transition), there is a slip velocity and temperature jump observed at the walls. Focussing on the slip velocity, it leads to a non-negligible work done by viscous stress force. Consequently, the transfer of energy due to viscous stress work leads to a change in the Nusselt number term which was previously just governed by the temperature gradient.

Total heat flux is the net effect of the heat flux due to diffusion and viscous stress work. 

Considering the experimental setup discussed in Hemadri et al, Nu_diff has a profile of the form-

(Correction- y-axis label should be Nu_diff)
(Zoomed in on thermal developing region)

As observed in the paper, there are are two asymptotic states. Nu_diff drops to zero after the flow becomes thermally developed. The spike in Nu_diff occurs right as the heating section of the pipe begins. The heating up of fluid before this point is thus attributed to axial upstream conduction.

On considering viscous stress work, we can now compare Nu_tot and Nu_diff-

(The asymptotic states are not quite distinguishable here due to lesser number of sampling points considered.)

Key observation-

Negative Nu_total post development implies that the heat generated due to viscous stress work is transmitted to the wall. 
Two asymptotic states (not captured in the second plot due to fewer sampling). The initial peak reduces with the sampling rate, implying that it exists for a very very small part of the tube.

(not inferred from this analysis) Significance of viscous stress work increases with degree of rarefaction.
